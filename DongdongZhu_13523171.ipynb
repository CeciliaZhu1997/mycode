    "**Answer:**<br>\n",
    "The organization selected is Xiaomi, a smartphone company that ranked 3rd in global smartphone market share in 2024. Xiaomi faces a communication challenge as it tries to transition from being a cost-effective brand to a high-end one. This shift has led to complaints from loyal customers about rising prices, while its product quality is often questioned by new customers as not being on par with other high-end brands like Samsung and Apple. While Xiaomi is highly dependent on its e-commerce channels (Giachetti, 2017), research finds that online consumer reviews (OCRs) can significantly impact users' purchasing decisions (Lovett et al., 2013), which can be further classified into emotional and functional categories(Jang et al, 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "To develop more targeted marketing strategies, Xiaomi needs to identify which type of reviews are more effective in driving sales for its high-end phones.The research question is:<br>\n",
    "On Xiaomi's official website (mi.com), what type of positive consumer reviews leads to higher sales of flagship smartphones?\n",
    "\n",
    "As Jang et al.(2021) argued, functional OCRs related to product quality and ease-of use tends to drive the most sales, with an interaction effect from emotional positive OCRs. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "***H1:*** Users exposed to functionally positive comments will be more likely to make a purchase (a) and spend a higher amount (b) compared to those exposed to emotionally positive comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "***H2:*** Users exposed to emotionally positive comments will be more likely to make a purchase (a) and spend a higher amount (b) compared to those exposed to regular positive comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the referral source is included as a moderator in this case. I argue that users from social media channels (i.e., those who are familiar with Xiaomi and follow its social media accounts) will be more influenced by both emotionally and functionally positive reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "***H3:*** Referrals from social media have a positive moderating effect on purchase amounts.\n",

    "In the cells below you should load the dataset(s) into pandas to begin the data understanding and preparation. It is important to provide the reader with sufficient information to understand how the data were collected, and what the dataset is about. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you should answer at least adress the following topics in this section:\n",
    "* What is the dataset about? How does it relate to the business challenge?\n",
    "* What is the source of the data? \n",
    "    * You can for example think of Google Analytics or data collected through social media (when e.g., tracking effectiveness of campaigns)\n",
    "* How were the data collected? What type of data collection (and/or sampling) strategy was used, and why? \n",
    "* What are the potential biases that could be introduced in the dataset because of the data collection method?\n",
    "* How was privacy taken in consideration during data collection? What are some of the risks and/or privacy trade-offs that should be considered?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a tip: use a meaningful name for your dataset(s) when loading them into a Pandas dataframe. Calling them just *df* or *data* will become confusing later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** As part of open science and replicability, it is important to indicate also to the reader where the data is stored or located. In the case of the report, we expect you to upload the dataset to our SurfDrive folder, so we can download the data and replicate your results.\n"

    "Data was be collected from the English purchasing page of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, the brand's latest flagship model, on its official e-commerce website, mi.com. The collection period will run from February 1 to 30 in 2025, after the shopping festivals at the end of year to avoid discount-related influences and ensure regular user feedback. Thus, typical purchase data for Xiaomi’s high-end product can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the brief's design, positive reviews will be categorized into emotional, functional, and regular types based on Jang et al. (2021). 1% of visitors will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group A (emotional reviews), Group B (functional reviews), and Group C (regular reviews). Each group will see 300 reviews, while negative and neutral reviews remain unchanged. The datasets include (1) Metrics: id, purchase, purchase_amount; (2) Users: id, regions; (3)Information: session_id, user_id, condition, referral, to conduct two 2x3 designs with all variables included.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential bias is that the data only includes users from the brand's website, likely those already familiar with the brand, excluding consumers from other channels like third-party distributors. Though users have read the agreements to share their cookies with the website, data spillover could exist. Users' shopping data was collected, like address andreferral channel, their behavior patterns such as comsumption and media use habits can be inferred.\n",

    "The main issue with the dataset is that there were no purchases recorded in Group A, likely due to the randomly generated data. However, as I replaced missing values with 0 for purchases, it will not impact the feasibility of the model.<br>\n",
    "I also tried to randomize and regenerate the data for `AB_test`, `_purchase`, and `purchase_amount` following suggestions proposed by Dr. Strycharz in the issues section on GitHub. However, the newly generated data were always too perfect for statistical models and machine learning applications. Therefore, I decided to use the original database, which, despite being unbalanced, should still allow the code to work."

    "\n",
    "**(1) Purchase Decision Across Conditions:**\n",
    "Users exposed to Group A (emotionally positive reviews) did not make any purchases. For Group B (functionally positive reviews) and Group C (control group), on average, Group C(0.57) showed a slightly higher mean of purchases made by users in Group B(0.56). However, it is difficult to determine if this difference is statistically significant for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Purchase Amount Across Groups:**\n",
    "The mean purchase amounts are also very close between Group B (87.83), and Group C (88.47). However, the data patterns of these two groups are very similar, while users in Group A did not make any purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Referral as a Moderator:**\n",
    "Users referred from social media tend to have higher purchase amounts than those who were not in Group B and C. But still, the data patterns between those two groups are very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "For potential data biases, the data was collected from Xiaomi's official e-commerce website, meaning all users were digitally connected. A large proportion of the population without digital access or with lower digital literacy was excluded, which could lead to data bias.\n",

    "* If appropriate, explaining which strategy you are using to fine tune or improve the model\n",
    "* Discussion about the model evaluation (i.e., why you believe the model is a good model) and, if appropriate, comparison between different models\n",
    "* After the appropriate model is identified, then the hypothesis can be tested. You can then report the result of the tests being used to test the hypothesis (as discussed in the criteria for the assignment), explaining to the reader how the test is being made and what the results of the testing mean for the hypothesis at hand. \n",

    "* We consider as different models both when different features/variables are being tested (to achieve the same objective), or when different algorithms are being tested (with the same features/IVs)\n",
    "* It is important to explain to the reader what the model contains/is, and also how it is being evaluated. When the evaluation is done, it is also important to discuss what the result means in the current context\n",
    "* As the focus of this course is on predictive analytics, it is expected that predictions are made (using scikit-learn) and discussed after a hypothesis is tested. This means that when ANOVAs or T-Tests are used (as statistical testing), and equivalent OLS/Linear Regression Model (in scikit-learn) needs to be used to make predictions. All tests need to be done in Python, using statsmodels and/or scikit-learn."

Users exposed to Group A (emotionally positive reviews) did not make any purchases, while those exposed to the control group had a slightly higher likelihood of making a purchase than those in Group B (functionally positive reviews). However, the purchase amounts between these two groups did not show statistically significant differences. When referral is involved as a moderator, users referred from social media atend to have a higher purchase amount compared to those who are not referred from social media. To answer the research question, emotionally positive reviews do not drive sales, whereas functionally positive and regular positive content can slightly increase sales (see the folowing visualization).\n",

    "For Xiaomi, this conclusion suggests that the content of positive online consumer reviews does not significantly impact sales. Instead, the company should focus more on understanding its customers' features and preferences. In this study, individuals referred from social media displayed a higher willingness to purchase, likely because they are already familiar with the Xiaomi brand (such as being exposed to this brand on social media before) or have followed its social media accounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, according to the data analysis result, the recommendations for Xiaomi are as follows:<br>\n",
    "(1) It should target its marketing efforts more towards its existing social media followers, for example, increasing the appeal of its post visuals and providing more positive content (both emotional and functional) based on its phone features.<br>\n",
    "(2) It should also invest more in social media advertising to reach more potential users and thus increase brand impressions.<br>\n",
    "(3) It can also be inferred that promotional content targeted at users who are familiar with the brand will be more effective in driving sales. Therefore, both online and offline advertisements should be increased to help build brand awareness among users. <br>\n",

    "(1) The potential limitation of the data collection is that it only includes purchases from official websites, while a large number of third-party vendors were overlooked, which could yield significantly different results compared to official websites. Relying solely on online data collection could also overlook the offline market, potentially leading to inaccurate results due to the limited sample size. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The moderator variable `social_media` only includes a few channels, while others that may also fall under social media could have been excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Since the study examines the respective impacts of different types of online consumer reviews, it overlooks the interactive or moderating effects between emotional and functional comments, as demonstrated by Jang et al. (2021). In addition, the unbalanced dataset used in this study could significantly influence the model's fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) An alternative interpretation of the positive moderating effect of social media is to consider the demographics of social media users. For example, users referred from this channel may be younger and, therefore, have a higher need to change their phones compared to senior citizens. In this case, Xiaomi should focus on targeting a younger age group in its marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Based on the current progress, I would suggest the following next steps:\n",
    "- Collect a more balanced dataset that includes purchases in Group A.\n",
    "- Set up another treatment group that includes both emotionally and functionally positive consumer reviews to explore their interactive effects.\n",

    "The first issue is users' right to informed consent in this specific case. Users will not know they are being exposed to only certain types of positive reviews. Although the A/B test design proposed in the brief includes several actions to mitigate the impact (such as keeping the proportion of participants very low, using existing and authentic positive reviews, and leaving neutral and negative reviews unchanged), users assigned to this study will still be influenced, potentially affecting their rights as consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second potential ethical issue concerns data privacy. While users logging into mi.com have granted their cookies (or partial cookies) to the company, allowing it to use their data, this can still lead to several risks. For instance, their data is now repurposed to monitor and increase sales without detailed explanation. A particular concern is data spillovers (Tucker, 2009), as users' shopping profiles contain personal information that could be tracked to reveal specific behavioral patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, while we are using machine learning models to predict users' behavior in this study, readers of the data analysis should also pay attention to the trust issue between humans and artificial intelligence (Hind, 2019). Explainable AI, which was adopted in this study, provides an approach to explain how machine learning models make their decisions. However, this should not only be presented in research but should also be communicated by the company if AI is used to handle personal data, ensuring that data subjects are properly informed.\n",
